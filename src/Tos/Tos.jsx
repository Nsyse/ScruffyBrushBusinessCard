                <ul>
                    <li>I will ask for your paypal email so I can send you an invoice.</li>
                    <li>The invoice must be paid in full before I start.</li>
                    <li>I do not take alternative payment methods.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Timeliness</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usually, completing a commission takes me 2-4 drawing sessions spaced out over 2-4
                        weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>I aim for but do not guarantee a 2 week turnaround. Let me know if you have a deadline to meet and I'll let you know if I think I can make
                        it.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may request a cancellation and a full refund if I fail to deliver by a
                        given deadline or take longer than 3 weeks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Edits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>It's never too late to fix a mistake</em>, especially something obviously missing (eg: A finger/tail
                        (Oops!) or something you specified and I forgot.)
                        <br/>I'm happy to make adjustments of any kind appropriate to the current step of the process.
                        <br/>Please point out issues or changes you'd want as early as possible to minimize how much work I have to redo!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Essentially, I try to work in stages. Ideally I'll submit a stage and expect edit requests that match how
                    far in
                    the process we are at. I will provide a full refund and cancel the commission if excessive
                    edits are
                    requested repeatedly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rough thumbnail ideas : Complete do-overs are expected and more than welcome. If there's
                        any moment to try other ideas it's now. I frequently do multiple very rough
                        sketches to try to capture our idea's general composition if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rough Sketch : Once a general pose/thumbnail is picked I can still do major changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Render : After all the limbs are in place and I ask for your go I can still rework
                        details, but ideally not composition/pose.
                    </li>
                    <li>Coloring and shading: Once the render is satisfying and I have your go I will only
                        change colors
                        and shading.
                    </li>
                    <li>Completed: Once the piece is satisfying I'll only do minor and mistake requests up to 2
                        weeks
                        after completion.
                    </li>

                        desired.

                    <li>You are allowed to use the piece as you see fit for personal use.</li>
